Here are the options:<br/><b>open</b> - Everyone can see the coordinates unless the taxon is threatened. <br/><b>obscured</b> - Public coordinates shown as a random point within a 0.2 by 0.2 degree area that contains the true coordinates, which works out to about a 22x22 km square area of uncertainty at the equator, decreasing as you approach the poles. True coordinates are only visible to you and the curators of projects to which you add the observation. <br/><b>private</b> - Coordinates completely hidden from public maps, true coordinates only visible to you and the curators of projects to which you add the observation. <br/><br/>Note that curators of individual projects can always see the coordinates regardless of your geoprivacy setting, so if you are concerned about who has access to the coordinates you should be sure you trust the curators of the projects in which you participate. ]]></string>
