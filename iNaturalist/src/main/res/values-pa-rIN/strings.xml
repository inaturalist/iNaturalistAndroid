True coordinates are only visible to you and the curators of projects to which you add the observation. <br/><b>private</b> - Coordinates completely hidden from public maps, true coordinates only visible to you and the curators of projects to which you add the observation. <br/><br/>Note that curators of individual projects can always see the coordinates regardless of your geoprivacy setting, so if you are concerned about who has access to the coordinates you should be sure you trust the curators of the projects in which you participate. ]]></string>

All iNaturalist servers are provided and hosted by Microsoft, all iNaturalist images are hosted by Amazon, and almost all iNaturalist maps are served by Google, which means every time you look at an observation on iNaturalist, you are connecting to services provided by these companies and exposing your IP address to them, at the very least (in the iPhone app we use Apple’s maps). iNaturalist probably would not exist without the services these companies provide, and while we can limit the amount and kinds of data you share with them while using iNat, we cannot stop the flow of data entirely.]]></string>
